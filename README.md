Modding tools for Golden Sun and other Camelot games.

# Setup

This project is still in development, and so is this process.
1. Install Python 3.8 or above.
1. From the project root, create the virtual environment: `python3 -m venv .venv`
   - Note: On some platforms you might use `python` instead of `python3`.
1. Activate the virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
   - No idea what this looks like on Windows, sorry.
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Running

Ensure your virtual environment is active, then run the app with `python cli.py`
